# Impact of Data Domain on FSR Training
The objective of this repository is to test the transferability of the FSR module proposed in [Feature Separation and Recalibration for Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13846).

The codes are modified based on [the original implementation of FSR](https://github.com/wkim97/FSR).
